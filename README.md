<details><summary><b>Towed Artillery to Vets Who Code</b></summary>

I am a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. From working with howitzers to writing code, it's been an amazing journey. Initially, I sought a career working with data and studied SQL, MSSQL Server, and Oracle Database. But then I took classes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  While I enjoyed working with data, I found front-end web development to be more rewarding. It was at this point I discovered [Vets Who Code](https://vetswhocode.io/) and through this organization, studied front-end development. Working with, and learning from, veterans while developing skills has been an amazing and rewarding experience. I love using these new skills, while developing them further, to create content that I can share for others to enjoy.
